\begin{abstract}
The idea of autonomous cars and connected vehicles is becoming increasingly
pervasive in research labs and car manufacturing companies. It is inevitable
that roads are going to accommodate autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles
in the near future. However, like other technologies filtering into humans
daily life, the transition from conventional transportation systems to
autonomous vehicles requires careful involvement of human-oriented factors into
related technologies. We believe employing cognition in vehicular decision
making processes improves the awareness and consequently safety and comfort in
the roads. Here, we discuss how affect-driven integration of cognition into
connected vehicles can do so.

\section{Become Connected, Become Aware}

In February~2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
announced that Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), including connected
vehicle technology, will be required in all cars by 2019~\cite{factsheet}.
Subsequently, there has been a significant increase in research activities with
respect to vehicular networks (VANETs) in respond to this urgent need to
address vehicular traffic safety concerns~\cite{ntsb}. Toyota Group recently
announced that it is investing \$$50~M$ to design and produce artificial
intelligence within vehicular networks ~\cite{toyota50M}. The information flow
within a connected vehicle network, which includes both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), is managed via the broadcasting of control
messages over a control channel. In Europe, these messages are referred to as
Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) while in the United States they are called
Basic Safety Messages (BSMs). Shared information, such as vehicle position,
motion characteristics, and vehicle size, are used for increasing the overall
environmental awareness in support of \textit{safety applications,}
(\textit{e.g.,} intersection movement assist, left turn assist, do not pass
warning sign, and light violation warning) as well as \textit{mobility
applications,} (\textit{e.g.,} collision warning, road coefficient of friction,
road conditions, parking management, and payment
solutions)~\cite{hardingNHTSA14}.

Semi and fully autonomous vehicles improve traffic safety by preventing
human-driver mistakes. Google and Ford are performing one of the mainstream
trials of autonomous vehicles while Volvo and Honda are working on increasing
vehicles' awareness through providing robust connectivity in vehicular
environments. Connected vehicles stand as a breakthrough in intelligent
transportation, while introducing some technological challenges. In order to
enable robust and efficient ITS mechanisms, several technical challenges
associated with autonomous vehicles must be addressed, including:

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figs/prototype.pdf}
  \vspace*{-2mm}
  \caption{{\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont Our prototype autonomous vehicle.}}
  \label{fig:pareto}
  \vspace*{-6mm}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Human-driver errors confront autonomous systems with unexpected
situations that make predefined decision mechanisms insufficient,
\item Dynamic vehicular environments include obstacles that vary with time,
changing number of vehicles, and varying road topology,
\item Decision making mechanisms in ITS are not delay-tolerant since the network
environment changes rapidly,
\item Frequently broadcasting between connected vehicles causes overhead on
processing unit at each vehicle.
\end{itemize}

One promising feature that is under investigation in autonomous cars is
cognition. Cognition enables vehicles to improve the quality of drive by
improving safety of the vehicle's occupants and other vehicles~\cite{cogcar}.
Moreover, the driver or passenger's thoughts and habits will be linked to
decision processes. This feature provides a method to transition from fully
human driven to half autonomous and half human driven, and finally to fully
autonomous driven vehicles on roads.

We believe cognition in connected vehicles can:

\begin{itemize}
  \item reduce the amount of errors on the roads caused by drivers, since
  autonomous vehicles not only drive based on more accurate perception, but also
  include the behavior models of their neighbors before making any decision,
  \item reduce the amount of required communication since the autonomous cars
  only need to transfer high level decisions based on their own sensory
  information rather than an enormous amount of low level sensory data,
  \item improve the quality of travelling on the roads in terms of safety and
  comfort, since cognition increases awareness of each autonomous vehicle on the
  road.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Connected Vehicles and Driving Environments}

\subsection{Building Blocks of A Connected Vehicle}

Hardware components shape the technical practicality and readiness of ITS
solutions~\cite{hardingNHTSA14}. The proposed cognition framework uses existing
components without requiring extra functionality. The intra-vehicle components
are categorized in six main blocks as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:invehComp}. As
shown, the internal vehicle components include two DSRC radios, which
standardization is still under development. One proposal is to dedicate one
radio permanently to safety messages. An alternative proposal is to design a
multi-channel hopping algorithm to use the radios adaptively. These radios
provide information sharing with other ITS members to increase awareness on the
roads.

Another vital component for cognition in vehicles is the Global Positioning
System (GPS) receiver for gathering position and timekeeping information. A
computer processing unit uses this information with the data generated from
onboard sensors such as heading, speed, and acceleration to provide the
information to intra- and inter- vehicle intelligence systems. The safety
electronic control unit prepares BSMs to periodically broadcast in order to run
the safety applications. The memory unit satisfies the needs of the data
acquisition system and records the historical data on the cognition of its
own and other vehicles. The memory unit also stores security certificates.
Lastly, a driver-vehicle interface would issue warnings to the driver. Such
warnings could be audible, visual, or haptic, e.g., any type of audio-visual
alarm, tightening of the seat belt, or vibrating the driver's seat.

\subsection{Roads as Social Environments}

A social environment contains one's social relationships including one's
resources and physical surroundings. A social relationship is the most dynamic
part of a social environment. Hence, developing and maintaining positive social
relationships is crucial for a social environment and is influenced by the
individuals' quality of interaction. Roads are social environments in which
individual vehicles interact with each other through their ``nonverbal"
behaviors, each obeying the same traffic laws. However, there are many
violations of the laws on the roads all over the world on a daily basis which
leads to expensive and all-too-often heart-breaking failures. These failures are
mostly caused by the failure of drivers to effectively interpret their driving
environment and make appropriate decisions with respect to their constraints
such as lack of time, lack of perception, and a plethora of cognitive load.
Therefore, it is crucial to involve awareness in the vehicles to share the
\textit{meaning} of what they perceive rather than broadcasting data coming
from their sensory system. For example, any sensory information leading to an
alert on a particular vehicle does not necessarily have the same meaning for
both the occupants and the neighbors of that vehicle. The alert warns the
occupants of the vehicle to be aware of an internal failure (e.g., malfunction
in the transmission system), or an external adversary (e.g., an animal
unexpectedly leaping into the road). The same alert has a different meaning
for the close vehicle approaching from behind; no matter what caused the alert
in the leading vehicle, the posterior vehicle should slow down effective
immidiately. However, the same alert can be interpreted in a totally different
way for a neighbor in front of the originally alerted vehicle. In fact, this
vehicle can ignore the received alert and continue the safe drive. Ultimately,
these type of improvements leads to a higher quality of vehicles' interaction
which consequently increases the safety of the roads.

\subsection{Driving Needs Pareto Optimal Decisions}

Cognitive architectures are used to solve high-dimensional multi-objective
tasks and to make proper decisions with respect to the dynamics of such
environments. Most of the time the real world problems possess a high level of
complexity due to the dynamism involved in the environment. A social environment
is an example of such complex environments. A social environment includes humans
as variety of sources making decisions independently but interrelated to each
other. Roads are social environments and driving is the social act of drivers'
behavior. It is clear that driving involves many decisions in which a driver
needs to maintain its own objectives while recognizing objectives of the others.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{figs/pareto-croped.pdf}
  \vspace*{-2mm}
  \caption{{\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont Pareto optimal decisions for the
  neighbors.}}
  \label{fig:pareto}
  \vspace*{-6mm}
\end{figure}

Let's consider two general objectives, \textit{Safety} and \textit{Comfort}, for
any driver while driving between the source and the destination. Indeed, all the
drivers would like to maximize both of these objectives. However, while they
need to obey the traffic law, they need to take into account their neighbors'
driving behaviors, and respect their objectives. In the example shown in Figure
\ref{fig:pareto}, the red car's driver wants to maximize her own safety and
comfort to her aspiration level for both objectives to obtain the ``preferred''
point. We believe at least for certain redius, the red vehicle should consider
objectives of the other vehicles in that neighborhood (four vehicles shown in
green), and update their anticipated and its own state based on their behaviors.
To achieve this goal, a cognitive system should be able to make decisions with
which it is impossible to change the state of self better off without making the
state of at least one of the neighbors worse off. Therefore, the cognitive
system's decision for any given event should be a pareto optimal solution, since
the neighboring connected vehicles' objectives are important for each individual
vehicle. Here, we only used the concept of pareto optimality to discuss the type
of decisions a cognitive system of a vehicle should make. Our cognitive system
and the underlying mechanisms do not take a game theoretic approach to make
decisions.

\section{Cognition Systems}

Integration of cogniton into connected vehicles needs us to understand the
building blocks of cognition, how do they relate to each other, and what
functional operations they provide. We choose Newell's general theory of
cognitive control, PEACTIDM \cite{newell:unified-cognition}, to describle the
underlying abstract processes of a cognitive system. PEACTIDM is a theory of
cognitive control where cognition is decomposed into a set of eight abstract
functional operations \cite{newell:unified-cognition} all of which are
hypothesized as the building blocks of one's immediate behavior. Figure
\ref{fig:peactidm} shows the sequence of PEACTIDM's building blocks.

\textit{Perceive} is the reception of raw sensory data. For instance, connected
vehicles receive data from both their own local sensory system (e.g., GPS) and
their neighbor vehicles (e.g., an abrupt change in their velocities).
\textit{Encode} is the transformation of the sensory data into features that the
cognitive system can process. In the cognitive architectures using Bratman's BDI
paradigm \cite{bratman:intentions-plans} each sensory data will be tranformed
into a new \textit{belief}. The cognitive architecture will be able to use these
beliefs in different processes. For example, in connected vehicles there will be
a belief about the current accelaration value of the vehicle which corresponds
to the sensory data indicating this value. \textit{Attend} is the act of
shifting or maintaining the focus of attention on an event. For instance, an
alert raised because of a sudden speed reduction of multiple leading neighbor
vehicles needs to be attended immediately while the same alert does not need the
same level of attention if the leading vehicles are a few miles apart.
\textit{Comprehend} is the act of trnasforming an event into a goal or
task-spcific representation and inferring the curent status of the world. For
instance, a vehicle receiving an alert requiring an immediate reaction needs to
identify the cause of the problem even though the alert has raised and received
from another vehicle. Thus, the receiver of the alert can apply replanning if
necessary.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.485\textwidth]{figs/peactidm-croped.pdf}
  \caption{{\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont PEACTIDM}}
  \label{fig:peactidm}
  \vspace*{-6mm}
\end{figure}

\textit{Tasking} is the process of recognizing a goal based on the new state of
the world. For example, a vehicle can recognize a goal in the plan to exit the
highway with respect to the new beliefs about an accident a few miles ahead and
the current state of the highway which causes constant speed reduction.
\textit{Intend} initiates a future action based on the current goal as response
to the current event. For instance, if the current goal of the vehicle is to
leave the highway, the vehicle begins to change the lane to the right most to be
able to take the next exit. \textit{Decode} translates the response based on the
given \textit{intention} into a series of motor actions. For instance, if the
intention is changing the lane to the right, The vehicle applies a series of
actions including using the right blinker, checking the occupancy status of the
right lane, and turning the steering wheel to the right whenever it is
appropriate. \textit{Motor} executes the actions decoded based on the given
intention. For example, in case of a lane change, the blinker starts to blink
and the wheels turn to the right respective to the amount of change on the
steering wheel.

\section{{\fontsize{11.5}{9}\selectfont Affective Motivational Collaboration
Theory}}
\label{sec:amct}

\textit{Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory}
\cite{shayganfar:theory-overview} is about the interpretation and prediction of
observable behaviors in a dyadic collaborative interaction. Affective
Motivational Collaboration Theory specifies the processes involved in the
progress of a collaboration and how they impact the collaboration's underlying
structure. This theory is built on the foundations of the \textit{SharedPlans}
theory of collaboration \cite{grosz:plans-discourse} and the \textit{cognitive
appraisal} theory of emotions \cite{gratch:domain-independent}.

The theory focuses on the processes regulated by emotional states. It aims to
explain both rapid emotional reactions to events as well as slower, more
deliberative responses. The observable behaviors represent the outcome of
reactive and deliberative processes related to the interpretation of the self's
relationship to the collaborative environment. Affective Motivational
Collaboration Theory aims to explain both rapid emotional reactions to events as
well as slower, more deliberative responses. The reactive and deliberative
processes are triggered by two types of events: \textit{external} events, such
as the other's \textit{nonverbal behaviors} and \textit{primitive actions}, and
\textit{internal} events, comprising changes in the self's mental states, such
as belief formation and emotional changes.

Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory explains how emotions regulate the
underlying processes when these events occur during collaboration. This theory
elucidates the role of motives as goal-driven affect-regulated constructs with
which an agent can form new intentions to cope with internal and external
events. Therefore, a new motive can become a new intention and the self can take
a new action based on the new intention.  The focus of underlying mechanisms is
on the ones depicted as mental processes in Figure \ref{fig:cpm} along with the
mental states.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.485\textwidth]{figs/theory-general-croped.pdf}
  \caption{{\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont Computational framework based on
  Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory (arrows indicate primary
  influences between mechanisms).}}
  \label{fig:cpm}
\end{figure}

The \textit{Mental States} includes ego's (vehicle's) beliefs, intentions,
motives, goals and emotion instances as well as the anticipated Mental States of
the neighbors (other vehicles). For instance, every sensory data, every
threshold value, or every inferred information about the world has a
corresponding belief in the Mental States. The \textit{Collaboration} mechanism
maintains constraints on actions, including task states and the ordering of
tasks. Although maintaining safety and comfort is a goal for each individual
vehicle, all vehicles also have a shared goal to achieve which is sharing the
road with others -- at least partially -- to get to their destinations.
Therefore, vehicles require a mechanism to maintain their full or partial shared
plan. The \textit{Collaboration} mechanism also provides processes to update and
monitor the shared plan. The \textit{Appraisal} mechanism is responsible for
evaluating changes in the ego's Mental States, the anticipated Mental States of
the neighbors, and the state of the collaboration environment. The outcome of
appraisal impacts every vehicle as an evaluative, regulatory, or motivative
process. For instance, \textit{expectedness} of an event indicates how prepared
is the ego to cope with the event, or how to maintain current state with respect
to the current changes in neighbors' location. The \textit{Coping} mechanism
provides the ego with different coping strategies associated with changes in the
ego's mental states with respect to the state of the collaboration. For
instance, does ego need to change speed with respect to the current state of
the road, or does it need to replan to get to the destination. The
\textit{Motivation} mechanism operates whenever the ego a) requires a new
motive to form a new intention with respect to current event, or b) wants to
interpret a neighbor's motive whenever the neighbor's behavior triggers an
alarm after ego appraising the situation. The \textit{Theory of Mind} mechanism
is the mechanism that infers a model of the neighbor's anticipated mental state.
The ego progressively updates this model during the collaboration. A neighbor's
model impacts ego's decision with respect to the state of the neighbor.

\section{Example Scenario}
\label{sec:example-scenario}

According to the analysis of the lane change by the US' National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2003 \cite{nhtsa:lane-change} more than
38\% of pre-crash movements in the highways was caused by typical lane change.
Furthermore, according to the NHTSA's traffic safety facts of February 2015
\cite{nhtsa:crash-stats}, about the 94\% of the critical reasons of
pre-crashed events are attributed to the drivers. As mentioned in this report,
about 41\% of the driver-related critical reasons are because of the
\textit{\textbf{drivers' recognition errors}} including driver’s inattention,
internal and external distractions, and inadequate surveillance. Also, about
33\% of pre-crash reasons are caused by the \textit{\textbf{driver's decision
errors}} such as driving too fast for conditions, too fast for the curve, false
assumption of others’ actions, illegal maneuver and misjudgment of gap or
others’ speed. In our hypothetical example, we show how the involvement of
different mechanisms in our framework can improve safety and comfort for both
the ego vehicle and the other neighbor(s) in the roads for such conditions.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centerline{\epsfig{figure =figs/ex1.pdf, height=1.45 in}}
  \vspace*{-2mm}
  \caption{Being aware of other drivers' intention.}
  \label{fig:example1}
  \vspace*{-5mm}
\end{figure}

In this example (see Figure \ref{fig:example1}), autonomous Vehicle
\textit{A} (ego vehicle) travelling in the right lane wants to take Exit
\textit{x} in two miles. However, the ego vehicle has decided to pass the
slow-moving Truck \textit{D} before taking Exit \textit{x}, since it is late. At
the same time, Vehicle \textit{B}, travelling in the left lane, quickly
approaches a slower car, Vehicle \textit{C} in the same lane. Vehicle
\textit{B}'s driver decides to change lane to the middle lane to pass Vehicle
\textit{C}. Therefore, both the autonomous Vehicle \textit{A} and the driver of
Vehicle \textit{B} want to go to the middle lane at the same time; since the
middle lane is not occupied by any other vehicle. Hence, because both Vehicle
\textit{A} and Vehicle \textit{B} are not aware of each other's intention, they
can cause an accident irrespective of the responsibility of each vehicle with
respect to the traffic law.

In this example, the ego vehicle perceives a sudden change of lane by Vehicle
\textit{B}; then it appraises this event as \textit{relevant, undesirable,
unexpected}, and \textit{controllable}. The lane change by Vehicle \textit{B} is
relevant to ego vehicle since it decreases the utility of the current goal for
the ego vehicle; it is undesirable since the ego vehicle's attempted goal (lane
change) is not achieved (i.e., it is blocked); it is unexpected since the
Vehicle \textit{B} interrupted the ego vehicle pursuing its current goal; and it
is controllable since the ego vehicle still has three alternative goals to
pursue. The goal management process in our framework ranks all of the potential
goals based on their status in the plan structure, and the outcome of the self
and the reverse appraisal. Moreover, in this incident the ego vehicle does not
have a behavior model of the Vehicle \textit{B}, since Vehicle \textit{B} has
just reached to the ego vehicle and is perceived for the first time. Therefore,
first, the ego vehicle replaces the current goal with stay-in-the-lane goal for
the prupose of recovering from the blocked goal. In general, the ego vehicle
adopts one of the safe predefined tactical goals, e.g., stay-in-the-lane or
reduce-speed, as an alternative goal to which pursuing it raises unexpected and
undesirable events. Next, the ego vehicle chooses the \textit{restraint coping
strategy} to immediately pull back into the right lane to yield the the middle
lane to Vehicle \textit{B} avoiding any possible accident. Therefore, choosing
an appropriate coping strategy, the ego vehicle responds to the current goal
change using the sensory system and taking appropriate actions to pursue the new
stay-in-the-lane goal. The ego vehicle updates the Vehicle \textit{B}'s user
model to a reckless driver. As shown in this example, the cognition of the
autonomous vehicle prevented an accident which could happen because of the
drivers' recognition error caused by their inadequate survillance in the
highway.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centerline{\epsfig{figure =figs/ex2.pdf, height=1.1 in}}
  \vspace*{-2mm}
  \caption{Coping with the driving behavior of a reckless driver.}
  \label{fig:example2}
  \vspace*{-5mm}
\end{figure}

In the next incident (see Figure \ref{fig:example2}), the ego vehicle perceives
Vehicle \textit{B} quickly approaching from behind in the middle lane (event 1).
Vehicle \textit{B} changes its lane to the right lane (instead of left) to pass
the ego vehicle immediately after reaching the ego vehicle (event 2). As
shown in Figure \ref{fig:example2}, Vehicle \textit{B} has to switch back to the
middle lane quickly (event 3), since there is a slow-moving truck in the right
lane at a short distance ahead of the ego vehicle. However, Vehicle \textit{D}
makes another blockage for Vehicle \textit{B} in the middle lane. Consequently,
Vehicle \textit{B} has to switch to the left lane to pass this blockage (event
4). All these four events happen in a few seconds in the neigborhood of the ego
vehicle.

Similar to the first incident, the ego vehicle appraises the first event as
highly \textit{relevant, undesirable, unexpected} and \textit{controllable} for
the self, and \textit{relevant, desirable} and \textit{expected} with low value
of \textit{controllability} for Vehicle \textit{B}. Therefore, the ego Vehicle,
creates a behavior model for Vehicle \textit{B} with a probability of having
a \textit{speeding} driver. The next three events will be also appraised in the
same way. The ego vehicle updates Vehicle \textit{B}'s behavior model based on
each event, raising the probability of Vehicle \textit{B} having a
\textit{speeding} driver. Updating Vehicle \textit{B}'s behvior model based on
several events leads to a more accurate behavior model of Vehicle \textit{B}.
Consequently, the ego vehicle will be able to evaluate Vehicle \textit{B}'s
actions more accurately based on the reverse appraisal process. The outcome of
the self and reverse appraisal processes causes the goal management process to
employ another tactical goal, i.e., reduce-speed. Hence, the ego vehicle as the
outcome of the appraisal and the behavior modeling processess adopts
\textit{behavioral disengagement} as the most appropriate coping strategy.
Furthermore, Vehicle \textit{B}'s behavior model not only helps the ego vehicle
to be safe while travelling in its neighborhood, but it can also inform other
autonomous vehicles to drive carefully while Vehicle \textit{B} is in a short
distance from them.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centerline{\epsfig{figure =figs/ex3.pdf, height=1.1 in}}
  \vspace*{-2mm}
  \caption{Communicating the behavior model of careless driver.}
  \label{fig:example3}
  \vspace*{-5mm}
\end{figure}

In the last incident the ego vehicle (Vehcile \textit{A}) simply passes another
autonomous car (Vehicle \textit{B}) which is driving in the right lane with a
normal speed (see Figure \ref{fig:example3}). Vehicle \textit{B} also detects
the appearance of another autonomous vehicle in its own neighborhood. The ego
vehicle receives an alert from Vehicle \textit{B} regarding the car (Vehicle
\textit{C}) travelling a few hundred feet in front of them in the middle lane.
The alert message contains a vector of probabilities of the Vehicle \textit{C}'s
driver type indicating the following probabilities: 34\% chance of being
\textit{drowsy driver}, 32\% of chance of driving \textit{under the influence of
drugs or alcohol}, 28\% chance of being \textit{distracted driver}, and 6\%
chance of being a \textit{teenage driver}. These values are computed by the
Vehicle \textit{B}'s Bayesian behavior modelling process in the the Theory of
Mind mechanism. Comoputing these probability values is based on Vehicle
\textit{B}'s perception and appraisal of the road including the Vehicle
\textit{C}, even before the ego vehicle reaches to Vehicle \textit{B}.
Afterwards, the ego vehicle uses the content of the alert message to update it's
own behavior model of the Vehicle \textit{C}. Updating Vehicle \textit{C}'s
behavior model does not change the ego vehicle's current goal. It also does not
demand the ego vehicle to apply an immediate reactive change in its own driving
behavior. However, it replaces the current motive (i.e., maintain the current
speed) of the ego vehicle with a new motive (i.e., maintain the current distance
with Vehicle \textit{C}). Forming this new motive is based on the outcome of the
Theory of Mind (updated by another vehicle) and the Appraisal mechanisms. The
new motive is urgent since it requires an immediate change in ego vehicle's
driving behavior, and it is important since it is related to the current goal
that the ego vehicle pursues. Therefore, the new motive causes the ego vehicle
to adopt an \textit{active coping strategy} to circumvent the stressor (i.e.,
Vehicle \textit{C}) by maintaining its distance.

\end{figure}

The recent reports show that the traffic density and crash rate is highly
correlated. In~\cite{trb12}, the relationships between traffic density, speed
and crash rate are modeled based on the traffic reports in Denver, Colorado. In
Figure~\ref{fig:errorPlot}, the crash rate is shown in blue line based on the
data from this report without applying our proposed cognition framework in each
vehicle. The proposed cognition framework can reduce the crash rate caused by
human errors upto $80\%$. The red line in this figure
indicates a significant influence of using our proposed cognition framework
reducing the crash rate based on the same data.

%~\cite{hardingNHTSA14} 

Furthermore, the proposed cognition framework decreases the amount of
information flow due to communicating vehicles' decisions rather than their raw
sensory informaiton. Assuming each vehicle has 5 sensors,
Figure~\ref{fig:infoFlow} shows the change in amount of sensory information flow
with respect to the size of connected vehicles' network. In general, for $n$
number of connected vehicles, each vehicle sends 5 sensory information packets
to $n - 1$ neighbor vehicles. Therefore, the total number of times that the
vehicles of the given network exchange their sensory information is $5n(n-1)$.
On the other hand, using the proposed cognition framework each vehicle only
requires to communicate its decisions rather than its raw sensory information.
Hence, the number of information packet exchange for a network of $n$ connected
vehicles is $n(n-1)$. As a result, using the proposed cognition framework
provides a solution to messaging overhead.
